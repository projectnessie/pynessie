# For the main branch: let all CI runs complete, one after the other. This has a couple advantages:
# * Site deployments happen in commit-order
# * Saved Gradle cache are persisted in commit-order
# * (Potentially) more GH runners available for PRs
concurrency:
  # PRs: 1 CI run concurrently / older ones are cancelled
  # main branch: 1 CI run concurrently / all commits / no cancellation
